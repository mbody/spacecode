They have to code the behavior of their spaceship and to fight together against enemies !

Cheating is part of the game and make it all the more fun !

## Getting started

- Run `npm i` in the server folder to install deps
- Start server with `npm start` and launch http://localhost:3000 to display the game screen in the classroom
