# SPACECODE

A little game to teach kids to code (in python for now) in a classroom :

They have to code the behavior of their spaceship and to fight together against enemies !

Cheating is part of the game and make it all the more fun !

## Requirements

Having node/npm installed

## Getting started

- Run `npm i` to install deps
- Start server with `npm start`
- Open a browser to http://localhost:3000 to display the game screen in the classroom
- Next, head out to one of the client repo to start coding the behavior of your spaceship !!
