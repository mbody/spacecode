A little game to teach kids to code (in python for now) in a classroom :

They have to code the behavior of their spaceship and to fight together against enemies !

Cheating is part of the game and make it all the more fun !


## Getting started

 * Start [the server](./server/README.md) 
 * Open a browser on http://localhost:3000 and display it in the classroom
 * Ask the kids to download the repo and use the [client-python](./client-python/README.md) to code the behavior of their spaceshit to help the class fight the enemies !!

## Credits
